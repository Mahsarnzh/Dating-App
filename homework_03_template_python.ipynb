    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work with 3 data sets in this assignment. Two of the data sets will be explored in both R and Python. This allows you to direclty compare figures between the two languages. Two of the data sets are new while the third is a data set from the previous assignment. You will practice lumping low frequency counts in this assignment and consider the consequences of such actions. You will also practice visualizing continuous distributions using synthetic and real data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The three data sets for this assignment are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (WPIAL) Baseball Champions  \n",
    "  * All WPIAL Baseball Champions dating back to 1979  \n",
    "  * Problems 01 and 02 are associated with the WPIAL data  \n",
    "* Synthetic data created for this assignment to practice visualizing continuous distributions  \n",
    "  * 9 variables are included to give you practice visualizing different distributional shapes!  \n",
    "  * Problem 03 is associated with the synthetic data  \n",
    "* The EPA Air Quality System (AQS) data from homework 02  \n",
    "  * You will explore the continuous variable `daily_avg` in this assignment  \n",
    "  * Problems 04 and 05 are associated with the EPA AQS data  \n",
    "  \n",
    "You will explore the WPIAL and synthetic data in both R and Python. The EPA AQS data will only be explored in R.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The last problem, Problem 06, requires you to read in potential data for your final project. You may answer this problem in either Python or R.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem numbering in the Jupyter notebook is consistent with the R numbering. The Jupyter notebook therefore does **NOT** include Problems 04 and 05.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Please download all CSV files from the Canvas site and save them in the same directory as your RMarkdown file. The code chunks read in the CSV files assuming they are in the same directory.  \n",

    "The WPIAL is the Highschool athletic league in Western Pennsylvania. Each year Highschools across Western PA compete to win the Western PA title and move on to the State championship. For Baseball, the WPIAL is divided into multiple classes based on Highschool district size. Schools with fewer students compete in Class 1A while the largest Schools compete in 6A. The WPIAL Baseball Champions data are read in for you in the cell below. The data are assigned to the `wpial` object. There are three columns in the data set:  \n",

    "* `Class`: The Class designation (School size)  \n",
    "* `School`: The name of the School that won the championship  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data you are working with does not consist of all WPIAL winners. You are working with data starting from 1979 even though the first WPIAL Baseball championship took place in 1914. You are working with more recent data because school districts were very different over 100 years ago.  "
